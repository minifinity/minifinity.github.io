I was born here. Yes, we're known for the [beer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsingtao_Brewery).

**Languages**: English, Mandarin, C++, Python, Latin \
In that order of fluency. And a few Duolingo courses' worth of Japanese and German.

My favorite key is F-major!

**Useless talent**: I'm a half-decent [GeoGuessr player](https://www.geoguessr.com/user/68cb44ae5109ce1c18e7dcd5) \
